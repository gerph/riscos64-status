# RISC OS 64 CI build
#
# The 'release' job is triggered when a tag starting with a 'v' is created,
# which will create a GitHub release for the repository with the name of the
# version tag. The release will be a draft, and should be updated with
# changes as you see fit.

name: Test all binaries

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on:
#   * push on any branch.
#   * tag creation for tags beginning with a 'v'
on:
  push:
    branches: ["master"]
    tags: ["v*"]
  # Pull request events happen on pull request state transitions, so we probably don't want this here.
