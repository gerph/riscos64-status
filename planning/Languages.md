# Language ports

## Summary

Having different development and programming languages available is important for a healthy community. RISC OS has traditionally had a number of languages developed for it, and ported. Many of these have fallen by the wayside over time as the operating system has developed and maintainers have moved on.

For RISC OS 64, it is important to have languages available to allow developers to produce software. Historical languages are useful for continuity, and modern languages bring in more non-traditional users.

This page hopes to bring together information on languages which have been built for RISC OS 64.
