# Phase 7: Compatibility and future proofing

## Summary

In terms of future-proofing, there isn't a lot to include. However,
I have set aside phase 7 to move components into if they're not needed
at lower levels, and to introduce new modules needed by the system.

## Target functionality

| Name                      | Stack          | Functionality |
|---------------------------|----------------|---------------|
| AppPatcher                | Compatibility  | Functional |
