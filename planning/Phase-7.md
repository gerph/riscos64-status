# Phase 7: Compatibility and future proofing

[![Progress of phase 7](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/gerph/c26e8457269506554ec1f7533d2f9aed/raw/Progress-7.svg)](https://github.com/gerph/riscos64-status/wiki/Phase-7)

## Summary

In terms of future-proofing, there isn't a lot to include. However,
I have set aside phase 7 to move components into if they're not needed
at lower levels, and to introduce new modules needed by the system.

## Target functionality

| Name                      | Stack          | Functionality |
|---------------------------|----------------|---------------|
| AppPatcher                | Compatibility  | Functional |
